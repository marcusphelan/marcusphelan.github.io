This blog is mainly about reading and writing, from book reviews (of sorts) to tips on typesetting. It covers technical topics and popular science as well as music, food and photography. Nice stuff.

My writing projects will pop up here, or at least some of the thoughts I'm developing for them. Let me know what you're reading and writing too!
