This is a blog mainly about reading and writing, from book reviews (of sorts) to tips on typography. It also covers technical topics and popular science as well as music, food and photography. Nice stuff.

Bread and crushed ice are both very good on their own but the combination in a sandwich is not appealing. The original tagline for the blog was _A disjointed union of unrelated opinions_ but it sounded self-depricating so I changed it. New ideas for writing sometimes for from unusual combinations that are reached via circuitous routes, like the frog in the arcade game _Frogger_.
