### Amazon UK orders to Ireland 
Import charges applicable to Amazon UK customers in Ireland from 1 January 2021 are outlined below. The information is taken (mostly) from [Money Guide Ireland](https://www.moneyguideireland.com/buying-from-amazon-uk-after-brexit.html). A prior issue whereby some book customers had been charged 13.5% VAT on orders over €22 has been resolved by Amazon.

### Customs

| Amazon UK orders| less than €150[^1] | more than €150 |  
|:--|:--|:--|
| Made in U.K.| no duty | no duty |  
| Made outside U.K. | no duty | may be liable[^2]|  


### VAT 

|Amazon UK orders | less than €22[^3][^4] | more than €22|  
|:--|:--|:--|
| UK VAT | none |none | 
|Irish VAT| exempt | 13.5% or 21%[^5] |  


#### Notes 

- Amazon will show charges as _The Import Fees Deposit_ at checkout. This is their estimate of taxes and duties that may apply. Refunds for overestimates will be applied by Amazon; underestimates won't incur additional charges.
- Irish customers should see a 20% final price reduction at checkout on single Amazon items priced under £23.94 (based on January 2021 exchange rate).
- The VAT threshold is per _package_ **not** per _order_. You could set use multiple addresses to avoid VAT charges.
- Amazon has announced they will continue to accept eligible returns after Brexit.
- Prime members will avoid paying Irish VAT on the delivery charge.
- Third party sellers may not charge VAT as they are not registered.
- If customs and VAT is not applied by the UK seller, delivery companies will declare goods and charges must be paid prior to delivery.
- Details correct as far as I know. Official information available from [Revenue](https://www.revenue.ie/en/Home.aspx).
