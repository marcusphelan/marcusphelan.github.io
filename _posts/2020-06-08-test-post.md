This long-winded, and arguably extraneous introduction (more on this later) is by way of introducing the essay I wish to tell you about. [_Politics and the English Language_](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200151.txt "Project Gutenberg") by George Orwell is a fine prototype for the plain language movement.

The essay itself is short and can be read in under half an hour, and you might do better just to read it rather than this synopsis. However, I have endeavoured to reproduce the essence of the piece _mutatis mutandis_ without de-emphasising the core elements.[^1]

I will leave you with the six rules Orwell offers when in doubt about the effectiveness of one's writing:

1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.

If you dislike lists then perhaps a single quotation by the author will suffice.

>The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.
