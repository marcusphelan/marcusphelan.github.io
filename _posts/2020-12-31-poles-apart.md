### A New Ending
Overdubbed onto the start of Roger Water’s [_The Last Refugee_](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ewaLbC2PQiAL6e4VXmSkB?si=Nkmuwj9_QpyzM7nfMTlanA) is a series of excerpts in clipped English accents taken from BBC News and shipping forecasts. The track is on his 2017 record _Is This the Life We Really Want?_ which is infused with snippets of audio nostalgia. One of the announcements used in the song proclaims the last day of the year, Thursday 31 December, 1970.

On that day the United Kingdom was not a member of the European Economic Community. (The country would later join, along with Ireland, on 1 January 1973.) Of course the world was a different place then. The New Year’s Eve breaking news was that Paul McCartney had filed a lawsuit to dissolve the Beatles’ partnership. It signalled an inauspicious beginning to the coming decade, devoid of the wide-eyed optimism of the 1960s.

Today, fifty years later, another ending has come. The U.K. leaves the European Union. It does so at midnight according to CET in Brussels, the locus of EU power. Perhaps Greenwich’s Shepherd Gate Clock will solemnly mark it at 11pm. The GMT timepiece was bombed in the Blitz but thankfully survived the blast. The incendiary device that smashed into the observatory wall in 1940 serves as a touchstone for the alleged hegemony of present day Europe in the guise of the EU.

### Go Forth and be Merry
The divisive campaigns for both ‘leave’ and ‘remain’ (fought in a geopolitical atmosphere mired by Trump’s ascendance) felt to a casual observer like myself to be politics going through the motions. An imperfect system hijacked by extremists and ideologues. Will Big Ben’s Brexit bong bolster Britons’ belief in their inalienable right to influence world affairs? Perhaps it instead harkens back to the recent ringings of Westminster’s division bells. A soundtrack of internal strife. The political capital has now been spent and hubristic pantomime must be replaced by serious negotiations.

> So rebuild the railways,  
Firm up all the roads,  
No one is leaving,  
Now this is your home...  
All lost in a painting of a sky coloured oil,  
In this Merrie Land.  

>*Merrie Land* by The Good, the Bad and the Queen

Brexit is not the hill on which the U.K. will perish but it's inarguably a poor strategy for success in the _fitness landscape_ of European affairs. In time the self imposed restrictions of sovereignty may dissolve nebulous ambitions of ‘sunlit uplands’. The next generation of U.K. citizens may not nurture the same feelings of victimhood as their forebears, however justified they may be. The current relationship between the U.K. and the EU is on shaky ground, with Ireland in an awkward position. I hope the impoverished connections will (again) give way to newer and better bonds, over the next 50 years.
